Gravy is a sauce made from the juices of meats and vegetables that run naturally during cooking and often thickened with thickeners for added texture. The gravy may be further coloured and flavoured with gravy salt (a mix of salt and caramel food colouring) or gravy browning (gravy salt dissolved in water) or bouillon cubes. Powders can be used as a substitute for natural meat or vegetable extracts. Canned and instant gravies are also available. Gravy is commonly served with roasts, meatloaf, Subway sandwiches, rice, noodles, fries (chips), mashed potatoes, or biscuits (North America, see biscuits and gravy).

History
One of the earliest recorded mentions of gravy is in a British recipe book entitled “The Forme of Cury”, dating from the 14th century. The term gravy originates from the Old French word for meat or fish bouillon, which in fourteenth century French manuscripts was “gravé” or “grané”. It is suggested that  the French word grané is associated with grain, connecting grain’s usage in culinary terms as a sauce made from meat and served with meat.

Popularisation in different cultures
Some think that the establishment of gravy as a British household staple came as a result of a long-running advertising campaign by the British food product brand OXO. The advertisements, which ran on British television from 1983 to 1999, featured a middle-class British family eating meals with Oxo gravy. Gravy is now an integral ingredient in the classic British Sunday roast.
The long history of British colonization and immigration in North America has influenced food production and consumption in Canada and the United States. In North America, gravy is considered a popular sauce to accompany traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations and food, such as turkey and potatoes.
In the Southern United States, gravy and biscuits are popular breakfast foods that originated in Southern Appalachia in the late 1800s. While the South has developed various types of gravy, most contain sausage, flour, butter, and milk, affordable ingredients for working class families.
Gravy is one of three ingredients in the famous French-Canadian dish poutine, made up of French fries, cheese curds, and a salty, light brown sauce combining beef and chicken stock. Poutine emerged in rural Québec in the 1950s and has become one of Canada’s most iconic meals.
In Italian American culture, gravy is sometimes used to refer to meat-based tomato sauce.

Instant gravy
The first instant gravy was developed by the British company Bisto in 1908, as a meat-flavoured powder that can be combined with water and served with meat. Instant gravy is now sold by various companies, including Heinz, Knorr, and McCormick.

Cream gravy, or white gravy (sawmill gravy) is a bechamel sauce made using fats from meat—such as sausage or bacon—or meat drippings from roasting or frying meats. The fat and drippings are combined with flour to make a roux, and milk is typically used as the liquid to create the sauce, however, cream is often added or may be the primary liquid. It is frequently seasoned with black pepper, and complementing herbs and bits of meat may be added such as sausage or diced chicken liver. It is an important part of many Southern USA meals, and frequently used as an ingredient in casseroles and other southern dishes, such as biscuits and gravy and served alongside many Southern favorites such as mashed potatoes, fried chicken and chicken-fried steak. Other common names include country gravy, sawmill gravy, milk gravy, and sausage gravy.
Egg gravy is a variety of gravy made starting with meat drippings (usually from bacon) followed by flour being used to make a thick roux. Water, broth, or milk is added and the liquid is brought back up to a boil, then salt and peppered to taste. A well-beaten egg is then slowly added while the gravy is stirred or whisked swiftly, cooking the egg immediately and separating it into small fragments in the gravy.
Red gravy can refer to several different dishes. It is a simple, basic tomato sauce in New Orleans. In the Italian American communities it refers to a complex long- and slow-cooked tomato sauce, frequently with meats and vegetables, although the distinction between "sauce" and "gravy" in the Italian tomato world is debated. There are several red gravies from India, which are variations of tomato-based curry.

Onion gravy is made from large quantities of slowly sweated, chopped onions mixed with stock or wine. It is commonly served with bangers and mash, eggs, chops, or other grilled or fried meat which by way of the cooking method would not produce their own gravy.
Red-eye gravy is a gravy made from the drippings of ham fried in a skillet or frying pan. The pan is deglazed with coffee, giving the gravy its name, and uses no thickening agent. This gravy is a staple of Southern United States cuisine and is usually served over ham, grits or biscuits.
Vegetable gravy or vegetarian gravy is gravy made with boiled or roasted vegetables. A quick and flavourful vegetable gravy can be made from any combination of vegetable broth or vegetable stock, flour, and one of either butter, oil, or margarine. One recipe uses vegetarian bouillon cubes with cornstarch (corn flour) as a thickener ("cowboy roux"), which is whisked into boiling water. Sometimes vegetable juices are added to enrich the flavour, which may give the gravy a dark green colour. Wine could be added. Brown vegetarian gravy can also be made with savoury yeast extract like Marmite or Vegemite. There are also commercially produced instant gravy granules which are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans, though some of the leading brands are not marketed as being vegetarian.
