Puce is a brownish purple colour. The term comes from the French couleur puce, literally meaning "flea colour".
Puce became popular in the late 18th century in France. It appeared in clothing at the court of Louis XVI. The colour was said to be a favourite colour of Marie Antoinette; however, there are no portraits of her wearing it.
Puce was also a popular fashion colour in 19th-century Paris. In his novel Nana, Émile Zola describes a woman "dressed in a dark gown of an equivocal colour, somewhere between puce and goose shit." In Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, Mademoiselle Baptistine wears "a gown of puce-coloured silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since."
