Career
In 1978, during a question-and-answer segment with announcer Johnny Olson at a taping of The Price Is Right, Fields asked how he could get Olson's job. Olson brought Fields onstage and asked him to give an example of how he would call a contestant to "Come on down!"
Fields worked as a radio personality starting in 1979, serving some 16 radio stations across the country, including markets like Los Angeles, California, and Tampa, Florida.

On March 30, 2004, producer Roger Dobkowitz notified Fields that Dobkowitz had chosen him as the next announcer for The Price Is Right, a decision following the death of longtime announcer Rod Roddy. The announcement of Fields' hiring was announced by Bob Barker at the April 6, 2004, taping of the show, which aired on April 23. Fields signed a contract to be the series' announcer through 2010.
Fields served as the announcer of the All-Star summer tournament series Gameshow Marathon from May 31 until June 29, 2006, on CBS.
