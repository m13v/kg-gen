He played college football for the Texas Tech Red Raiders, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American.  He was selected in the fifth round, 22nd pick (154th overall), in the 1996 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins, and played for the Dolphins in his first 12 seasons in the NFL, before playing his 13th and final season with the Dallas Cowboys.

He was also named the AFC  Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1996. Thomas was also the first Dolphins player to win the Dolphins Team Leadership Award (voted by his teammates) a record three times (1998–1999, 2005), until Jason Taylor surpassed him with four (2002, 2006–2007, 2009).
From 1998 to 2006, Thomas led a defensive unit that finished top 10 in total defense in seven consecutive seasons (1998–2004), and in eight out of nine (2006). In five of those nine seasons (1998, 2000, 2002–2003, 2006), Thomas' defenses finished top five in total scoring defense, including 1st overall in 1998.
Thomas is also known for his longevity with the Dolphins, and currently is 2nd all time in Dolphins history for most games played by a defensive player in the team's history with 168, behind Taylor's 204. A seven-time Pro Bowl selection (the most ever by a Dolphins defensive player), and seven-time first (5) or second (2) team All-Pro, Thomas recorded more than 1,700 combined tackles (1,100+ solo) in his career which included leading the league in tackles twice (2002, 2006), topping at least 100 combined tackles (he topped 150+ tackles six times) in 10 out of his 12 seasons with the Dolphins, and currently ranks 6th on the NFL's all-time career tackles list.
