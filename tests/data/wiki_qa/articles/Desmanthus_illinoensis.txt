Desmanthus illinoensis, commonly known as Illinois bundleflower, prairie-mimosa or prickleweed, is a common plant in the central and southern United States.

Chemistry
The roots of D. illinoensis have been found to contain N,N-DMT, NMT, N-hydroxy-N-methyltryptamine, 2-hydroxy-N-methyltryptamine, and gramine.

Habitat
The plant can be found in many areas of the south, central, and midwestern United States.
It can often be found growing on the sides of roads, particularly on southern exposures, needing full sun and ample moisture during its short growing season. The mature plants often grow and flower in mowed areas. In many parts of its native habitat, road sides are only mowed twice a year. In the late spring and again in late fall. The early mowing helps clear away competitors that might impede growth. The late mowing chops up the dry seed pods resulting in some scarification and resulting in better germination.
USDA hardiness zones 5â€“8 are recommended for outside cultivation. The waxy seed coat needs to be scarified prior to planting.

Toxicity
The root bark contains gramine, which is toxic to some animals.

Uses
Nutrition
The plant is nutritious and high in protein.

The Land Institute in Salina, Kansas has done extensive research into the food uses of the seeds of this plant.  Studies found the dry seeds composed of 38% protein, compared to 40% for soybeans.

Ayahuasca analogue
To produce prairiehuasca, the roots are ground up with a North American native source of beta-Carbolines (e.g., Maypop) to make a hallucinogenic plant concoction analogous to the shamanic South American brew ayahuasca.
