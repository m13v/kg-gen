The state of Arizona has numerous symbols, many of which are officially recognized after a law passed by the state legislature, and were adopted in the 20th century. The first symbol was the motto, which was made official in 1864 for the Arizona Territory. Arizona became the second state to adopt a "state firearm" after Utah adopted the Browning M1911.
